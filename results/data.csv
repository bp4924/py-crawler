IANA-managed Reserved Domains
Certain domains are set aside, and nominally registered to “IANA”, for specific
		policy or technical purposes.
Example domains
As described in RFC 2606 and RFC 6761,
	a number of domains such as example.com and example.org
	are maintained for documentation purposes. These domains may be used as illustrative
	examples in documents without prior coordination with us. They are 
	not available for registration or transfer.
Test IDN top-level domains
These domains were temporarily delegated by IANA for the IDN Evaluation being conducted by ICANN.

Policy-reserved domains
We act as both the registrant and registrar for a select number of domains
		which have been reserved under policy grounds. These exclusions are
		typically indicated in either technical standards (RFC documents),
		or contractual limitations.
Domains which are described as registered to IANA or ICANN on policy
		grounds are not available for registration or transfer, with the exception
		of country-name.info domains. These domains are available for release
		by the ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee Secretariat.
Other Special-Use Domains
There is additionally a Special-Use Domain Names registry documenting special-use domains designated by technical standards. For further information, see Special-Use Domain Names (RFC 6761).

Business Excellence and Quality Management



We are committed to operations excellence and have had an ongoing Business Excellence activity for 
    the IANA functions since 2009. We are pleased to have received EFQM
        Committed to Excellence recognition for these departments following an assessment conducted by a panel of
    three independent assessors in August 2013.
Founded in 1989, EFQM (the European Foundation for Quality Management) is the not-for-profit membership foundation
    that publishes the EFQM Excellence Model, a comprehensive management framework used by over 30,000 organizations
    around the world. The model helps organizations achieve and sustain outstanding levels of performance that meet or
    exceed the expectations of all their stakeholders. It allows people to understand the cause and effect relationships
    between what their organization does and the results it achieves.
The model is based on the Fundamental Concepts of Excellence:

Adding value for customers
Creating a sustainable future
Developing organizational capability
Harnessing creativity and innovation
Leading with vision, inspiration and integrity
Managing with agility
Succeeding through the talent of people
Sustaining outstanding results

The Fundamental Concepts of Excellence form the basis for the criteria of the EFQM Excellence Model.
We engaged EFQM to perform the assessment and will use the analysis to identify improvements. We remain
    committed to using the EFQM model to perform continual review and improvement of the IANA services we provide to the
    community.
