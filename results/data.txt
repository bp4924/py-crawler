IANA-managed Reserved Domains
Certain domains are set aside, and nominally registered to “IANA”, for specific
		policy or technical purposes.
Example domains
As described in RFC 2606 and RFC 6761,
	a number of domains such as example.com and example.org
	are maintained for documentation purposes. These domains may be used as illustrative
	examples in documents without prior coordination with us. They are 
	not available for registration or transfer.
Test IDN top-level domains
These domains were temporarily delegated by IANA for the IDN Evaluation being conducted by ICANN.

Policy-reserved domains
We act as both the registrant and registrar for a select number of domains
		which have been reserved under policy grounds. These exclusions are
		typically indicated in either technical standards (RFC documents),
		or contractual limitations.
Domains which are described as registered to IANA or ICANN on policy
		grounds are not available for registration or transfer, with the exception
		of country-name.info domains. These domains are available for release
		by the ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee Secretariat.
Other Special-Use Domains
There is additionally a Special-Use Domain Names registry documenting special-use domains designated by technical standards. For further information, see Special-Use Domain Names (RFC 6761).

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN organization) respects the protection and privacy of Personal Information. This policy (Privacy Policy) and the Cookies Policy set out how ICANN organization, which for the purposes of this policy includes its affiliated organization Public Technical Identifiers (PTI) (collectively "we", "us", or "our"), and their managed or sponsored programs, will use and handle electronic information provided by or collected from individuals and what choices individuals have regarding the collection and use of the information. This Privacy Policy applies to all electronic collection and use of Personal Information, including via any mobile version of the websites, mobile applications, electronic mail, and other electronic services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the Platforms). The term "User" or "you" refers to (i) individuals that provide their own Personal Information or Personal Information of others on behalf of such other persons to us and (ii) any organization where a person provides Personal Information of others on behalf of such organization.
By using the Platforms, you (including any entity or person on whose behalf you are acting) agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, as updated. If you do not agree with the practices described in this Privacy Policy, please do not provide us with Personal Information or interact with the Platforms.
This Privacy Policy supplements, and does not supersede, any other privacy policy or statement from us relating to any of our unique programs.

Recordings, Photographs, and Transcripts: We collect and maintain recordings, photographs, and/or transcripts of public and closed meetings, including through virtual meeting Platforms, which contain your Personal Information if you are a participant. Such recordings, photographs, and transcripts of these meetings are processed based on our legitimate interest of promoting accountability, openness, and transparency. Such recordings, photographs, and transcripts of these meetings, and any Personal Information contained in them, may be publicly accessible. When meetings and sessions are hosted by us and recorded, we will notify you and other participants of the recording before the start of each meeting. When we record a meeting, your Personal Information contained in any recording and related transcript will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
This Policy does not apply to any meetings using a service that is not provided or supported by us, unless otherwise stated with respect to that service. Please note that individuals that elect to provide, host, or participate in a meeting not using a service not provided or supported by us are solely responsible for ensuring that participants give their informed consent to the recording, and that all legal requirements applicable to the collection, recording, and processing of Personal Information are fully satisfied.

We will store the User's Personal Information only for as long as is required to fulfill the purposes set out above. However, where we are required by law to retain a User's Personal Information longer or where a User's Personal Information is required for us to assert or defend against legal claims, we will retain the User's Personal Information until the end of the relevant retention period or until the claims in question have been resolved.



Sharing of Personal Information
We may share certain Personal Information with contractors and other agents for the purpose of Processing this information on our behalf and providing other services to us or to the User on our behalf. These third parties include providers that provide services such as data analysis, email transmission, customer relationship management (CRM), IT security, cloud service providers, database management, hotel and other travel service, asset management solutions, consultants, and financial or legal advisors. We require that these parties agree to handle this information in compliance with appropriate confidentiality obligations and security measures. We also may publish some Personal Information on the Platforms in a manner that is viewable by our community members, as described in the relevant program description.

We will not sell or otherwise share any Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes.



International Transfers
By using our Platforms or providing us with your Personal Information electronically, the User is directly transferring Personal Information and Non-Identifiable Information to us in the United States. The User's Personal Information also may be transferred and Processed in other countries where our staff or third-party service providers are located. The United States and such other countries may not have the same level of information protection as the User's jurisdiction.
Whenever such transfers are by one of our location in a country outside the United States to another of our location in the United States, they are based on contractual commitments, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses (according to EU Commission Decision 87/2010/EC or any future replacement), or other applicable data transfer arrangements, in order to contractually provide that your Personal Information is subject to adequate levels of data protection. You may request further information concerning such contractual commitments by sending a request to privacy@icann.org.
The User is solely responsible for compliance with any information protection or privacy obligations in the User's jurisdiction when using the Platforms or providing us with Personal Information. By submitting Personal Information, the User agrees to such Processing.



Information Security and Integrity
We will use reasonable industry standard safeguards (which may include physical, procedural and technical measures) to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of Personal Information it collects and holds. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information collected is complete and relevant to its intended use.
The Platforms contain links to other third-party websites, which are subject to the respective privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such linked third-party sites, and their owners and operators.
The Platforms may contain social media widgets including Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, and other features that may collect a User's Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information and may set Cookies on the User's devices unless the device or browser settings prevent such Cookies from being stored. Such social media widgets and features may be hosted by a third party. We are not responsible for the operation of such widgets and features, and any information collection will be subject to the privacy policy of the provider of such widgets and features, and not this Privacy Policy.
Due to the open communication nature of the Internet, we cannot represent, warrant or guarantee that communications stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties, loss, misuse, or alterations. While we will take reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of Personal Information received, WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OR COMPROMISE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. USERS ARE ADVISED THAT THEY SUBMIT SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION AT THEIR OWN RISK.



Do Not Track
Users' browsers may allow users to set a "Do Not track" preference. Unless otherwise stated, the Platforms do not honor "Do Not Track" requests.



Exercise of Data Subject Rights
Users may be entitled to obtain access to information on the Processing of Personal Information, to object to certain Processing, request information portability, and have their Personal Information rectified, deleted, or otherwise restricted in terms of Processing, in each case as permitted under applicable law. Users also may be entitled to withdraw any consent given with prospective effect with respect to the Processing of their Personal Information. Users can exercise these rights or learn more about the Processing of Personal Information by us, by sending a request to privacy@icann.org. Any request is subject to identity verification. All privacy-related access requests are taken seriously, and we will respond to request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any case, within the legally required period of time. Please note that certain Personal Information may be exempt from such access, correction, objection, or deletion rights pursuant to local laws.
If you are not satisfied with our response or believe that your Personal Data is not being Processed in accordance with the law, you also may contact or lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority or seek other remedies under applicable law.
If a User no longer wishes to receive certain electronic communications from us, the User may opt-out from such communication by following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of such communication or by accessing any available preference setting functionality in the Platforms.



Minors
We do not knowingly collect or require Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you believe your child has provided us with Personal Information, please notify us by email at privacy@icann.org.



Revisions to our Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes we make will be posted on this page. If we make material changes to how we treat your Personal Information, we will notify you. The date this Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have a deliverable email address for you, and for periodically monitoring and reviewing any updates to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our Platforms after such amendments will be deemed your acknowledgement of these changes to this Privacy Policy.

div: Domain Name SystemInternationalized Domain Name ,IDN,"IDNs are domain names that include characters used in the local representation of languages that are not written with the twenty-six letters of the basic Latin alphabet ""a-z"". An IDN can contain Latin letters with diacritical marks, as required by many European languages, or may consist of characters from non-Latin scripts such as Arabic or Chinese. Many languages also use other types of digits than the European ""0-9"". The basic Latin alphabet together with the European-Arabic digits are, for the purpose of domain names, termed ""ASCII characters"" (ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange). These are also included in the broader range of ""Unicode characters"" that provides the basis for IDNs. The ""hostname rule"" requires that all domain names of the type under consideration here are stored in the DNS using only the ASCII characters listed above, with the one further addition of the hyphen ""-"". The Unicode form of an IDN therefore requires special encoding before it is entered into the DNS. The following terminology is used when distinguishing between these forms: A domain name consists of a series of ""labels"" (separated by ""dots""). The ASCII form of an IDN label is termed an ""A-label"". All operations defined in the DNS protocol use A-labels exclusively. The Unicode form, which a user expects to be displayed, is termed a ""U-label"". The difference may be illustrated with the Hindi word for ""test"" — परीका — appearing here as a U-label would (in the Devanagari script). A special form of ""ASCII compatible encoding"" (abbreviated ACE) is applied to this to produce the corresponding A-label: xn--11b5bs1di. A domain name that only includes ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens is termed an ""LDH label"". Although the definitions of A-labels and LDH-labels overlap, a name consisting exclusively of LDH labels, such as""icann.org"" is not an IDN." +
